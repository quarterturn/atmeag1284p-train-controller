Arduino-based model train controller

This project aims to automate a model train line that does not run in a loop. It uses hall-effect sensors and magnets mounted to the underside of the train to detect train position, and create a realistic emulation of a train stopping at the ends of the line, as well as a central station. It runs the trains on the quarter hours, and can be configured to follow an on/off schedule.
